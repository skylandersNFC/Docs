# Skylander Format

## tfbSpyroTag_TagHeader

The header is 0x20 bytes long.

| Offset | Type                   | Description
|--------|------------------------|---------------
|  0000  | `uint32_t`             | Non-Unique Identifier for this toy, internally referred to as the serial number
|  0010  | `kTfbSpyroTag_ToyType` | (24 bit int) The Character ID of this Skylander (see [kTfbSpyroTag_ToyType.hpp](../source/kTfbSpyroTag_ToyType.hpp))
|  0013  | `uint8_t`              | [Error byte](#error-byte)
|  0014  | `uint64_t`             | The Trading Card ID, [Web Code](#web-code) is derived from this, internally this is separated into 2 `uint32_t`s, presumably to get around alignment issues
|  001C  | `uint16_t`             | The Variant ID of this Skylander (see [here](#variant-id) to understand how this works)
|  001E  | `uint16_t`             | The crc16-ccitt/false checksum for the first 0x1E bytes of the header

### Variant ID

The Variant ID is a 16 bit long bit field. Note that with the way some tags were programmed, some do not fit with the criteria perfectly. Additionally, the flag that determines if the Skylander is a SuperCharger is never acted upon by the games and is essentially meaningless.

| Shift | Mask | Type                  | Description
|-------|------|-----------------------|-------------
| 0x00  | 00FF | `kTfbSpyroTag_DecoID` | The [Deco ID](../source/kTfbSpyroTag_DecoID.hpp)
| 0x08  | 0001 | `bool`                | Whether or not this Skylander is a SuperCharger
| 0x09  | 0001 | `bool`                | Whether or not this Skylander possesses LightCore technology; includes LightCores, Giants, Battle Pieces, certain TT expansions, and Creation Crystals
| 0x0A  | 0001 | `bool`                | Whether or not this Skylander is an in-game variant
| 0x0B  | 0001 | `bool`                | Whether or not this Skylander is reposed, normally meaning it has a Wow Pow (decided from the year code)
| 0x0C  | 000F | `ESkylandersGame`     | [Year code](../source/ESkylandersGame.hpp)

### Web Code

The Web Code is derived from the Trading Card ID.
Similar to how we have base-16 or base-2 for hexadecimal and binary respectively, the web code is actually stored as base-29.
By this, I mean that, you can modulo the Trading Card ID by 29, and then put it through a lookup table to get the last digit of the web code,
you can then divide by 29 and repeat to get the second to last digit.
The lookup table consists of the characters `23456789BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ` in that order, such that the first item, item 0, is `2` and the last character, item 28, is `Z`.

Moreover, you can look at `Runes::PortalTag::StoreHeader()` [here](../source/PortalTag.cpp) for easier to read code.

### Trap

* The 0x40 bytes from offset 0x00 is the Magic Moment Data (encompasses the actual trapped villain).
* The 0x110 bytes from 0x40 is the Remaining Data (contains caches of previously trapped villains).

### Experience

Sum of all experience values. In SSCR instead, the experience value for each year must be more than or equal to the max to then read the next year's experience.

| Level | Experience |
|-------|------------|
| 1     | 0          |
| 2     | 1000       |
| 3     | 2200       |
| 4     | 3800       |
| 5     | 6000       |
| 6     | 9000       |
| 7     | 13000      |
| 8     | 18200      |
| 9     | 24800      |
| 10    | 33000      |
| 11    | 42700      |
| 12    | 53900      |
| 13    | 66600      |
| 14    | 80800      |
| 15    | 96500      |
| 16    | 113700     |
| 17    | 132400     |
| 18    | 152600     |
| 19    | 174300     |
| 20    | 197500     |

Note that vehicle experience in SuperChargers Racing uses the exact same experience amounts for levels, but instead of having different bytes for the 2012/13 experience etc... it is all self contained within the initial "2011" `uint24_t`.

### Area sequence

* The core skylanders at least store the tfbSpyroTagData struct twice, once from block 0x08/0x24 and again from block 0x11/0x2D, these are called data regions or data areas.
* The recently written to area is the one with the area sequence value that is one higher than the other, remember to take overflows into account (e.g., an area sequence of 0 is considered higher than one of 255).
* When writing to a figure, the game will switch to the lower area sequence value and set it to be the higher value incremented by 1.
* Certain games, like Trap Team, will throw an error if the two sequences become out of sync with another, whereas other games, like SSCR, do not mind.
* Note that there are two area sequences, one for blocks 0x08/0x24->0x10/0x2C and another for blocks 0x11/0x2D->0x15/0x31 (inclusive).

### Error byte

Used to reject tags for whatever reason; seems mostly tied to other franchises using the same RFID protocol to make sure they don't get interpreted as Skylander data.

By default, for all Skylander figures, this byte is set to 0. If a toy is read and this byte is not equal to zero, the game will in some way refuse the toy, however the way the game behaves upon doing so varies and can sometimes act in an unintended manner.
* In Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, Skylanders Giants, and Skylanders Trap Team, the toy will be considered unsupported and cannot be used in the game.
* In Skylanders SWAP Force, Skylanders SuperChargers, and Skylanders Imaginators, if no other Skylanders have been placed on the portal prior, the game will consider the toy unsupported. If a Skylander has been placed prior, the game will remember that character info from that figure index on the portal. If this toy is then placed on the portal with the exact same figure index (which can be done by unplugging and plugging back in the portal, or loading the same slot on emulated portals) that character will incidently be loaded instead - including halves of SWAP Force Skylanders and Senseis - regardless of the actual character on the tag or data on the previous tag. The new character will then act somewhat similar to Template Template, where changing Ownership and writing to the tag does not function.
* In Skylanders SuperChargers Racing, the game will constantly bring up the corrupted toy prompt before immediately closing the prompt, and then reopening, halting any further progress.

### Hat value

* [Hat enum](../source/kTfbSpyroTag_HatType.hpp).
* Note that the following ids are identical to the ids used in the file names of Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, Skylanders Giants, and Skylanders Trap Team minus 1. For example, The straw hat has id 9 on figures but has id 8 in the files. 
* The unused hat ids are not used.
* The padding hat ids were never intended to be used.

#### Lookup Algorithm
* In Skylanders Giants and Trap Team, check the oldest hat value, if it's not 0, return that, otherwise check the second oldest hat value, repeat, and so on.
* In Skylanders SWAP Force, SuperChargers, and Imaginators, the order is reversed: check the newest hat value, if it's not 0, return that, otherwise check the second newest hat value, repeat, and so on.
* When returning the SuperChargers hat value, add 256 to get the true hat ID.
* Note that SWAP Force, SuperChargers, and Imaginators also attempt to wipe all unread hat areas on every write.

### Platform bitfield

#### 2011 value:
* Bit 0: Wii
* Bit 1: Xbox 360
* Bit 2: PS3
* Bit 3: PC (maybe macOS as well)
* Bit 4: Nintendo 3DS

#### 2013 value:
* Bit 0: Android 32-bit (maybe Android 64-bit as well). Seems to also correspond to Wii U
* Bit 1: Xbox One
* Bit 2: PS4
* Bit 3: iOS 64-bit (maybe iOS 32-bit as well)
* Bit 6: Nintendo Switch

So for example, if the 2011 value is set to 3, then bits 0 and 1 are set, and therefore the figure has been used on Wii and Xbox 360.

Note that SSA JP for the Wii U incidently sets the Wii platform usage flag instead of the Wii U one.

### Region Count Identifier

Used as a reset indicator to make sure all data regions are correctly wiped. Skylanders Giants added 0x10 bytes of Magic Moment info and 0x30 bytes of Remaining Data info, these 2 extension structs form the "second data region", with the original info from SSA being considered the "first data region".

This amount is known as the `dataRegionCount`; 1 for SSA, 2 for all other games. Note that the Wii and Wii U versions of SSA JP act like all games after SSA, with 2 data regions.

The `regionCountID` is encoded with the formula `(1 << (dataRegionCount - 1)) - 1` which returns a bit index for `dataRegionCount`s above 1 - this is stored at blocks 09/25, byte 0x06. All games after SSA will set this value every write.

The game does a comparision with a bitwise OR if the bit is set to determine if all data regions have valid data.

* For Spyro's Adventure, the `regionCountID` is unused, and will be set to 0 when the figure is reset. As SSA's reset routine doesn't wipe the second data region information from the figure, the second data region info will still persist on reset. Later games can verify that the data in the second data region is invalid by reading that the byte is 0, the bitwise OR check fails, and the second data region info is treated as reset/empty.
* For Skylanders Giants and future games, the reset figure routine from these games correctly wipe the second data region information and set the `regionCountID` to the correct value to have it succeed on future checks. The check succeeds if ever written to by these games, and the second data region is always read correctly.

### Flags

* [Upgrade](#upgrades) flags: `((Flags2 & 0xF) << 10) | (Flags1 & 0x3FF)`
* Element Collection Count 1: `(Flags1 >> 10) & 3`
* Element Collection Count 2: `(Flags2 >> 6) & 7`
* Element Collection: `((Flags1 >> 10) & 3) + ((Flags2 >> 6) & 7) + ((Flags2 >> 11) & 3)`
* SSF Accolade Rank: `(Flags2 >> 9) & 3`
* SG Accolade Rank: `(Flags2 >> 4) & 3`

### Battlegrounds Flags

* Portal Master Level: `(BGFlags << 0x06) >> 0x1A`
* Ability Slot Count: `((BGFlags << 0x0C) >> 0x1E) + 1`
* Ability Level: `(BGFlags >> ((abilityIndex * 3) & 0xFF)) & 0x7`

### Vehicle Flags

Oddly, each level of the vehicle's shield and weapon occupies its own bit, even though it's impossible normally to purchase a level and skip one. This spans over a `uint16_t`.

* Bit 0: Shield level 1 purchased
* Bit 1: Shield level 2 purchased
* Bit 2: Shield level 3 purchased
* Bit 3: Shield level 4 purchased
* Bit 4: Shield level 5 purchased
* Bit 5: Weapon level 1 purchased
* Bit 6: Weapon level 2 purchased
* Bit 7: Weapon level 3 purchased
* Byte 1, Bit 0: Weapon level 4 purchased
* Byte 1, Bit 1: Weapon level 5 purchased

### Vehicle Mod Flags

* Performance Mod: `ModFlags & 0xF`
* Specialty Mod: `(ModFlags >> 4) & 0xF`
* Horn: `(ModFlags >> 8) & 0xF`

### Upgrades

* Bit 0: Whether or not the Skylander is on a path
* Bit 1: Path (0 = top, 1 = bottom)
* Bit 2: Upgrade 1 purchased
* Bit 3: Upgrade 2 purchased
* Bit 4: Upgrade 3 purchased
* Bit 5: Upgrade 4 purchased
* Bit 6: Path upgrade 1 purchased
* Bit 7: Path upgrade 2 purchased
* Bit 8: Path upgrade 3 purchased
* Bit 9: Soul Gem purchased
* Bit 10: Wow Pow purchased (or Sky-Chi for Senseis)
* Bit 11: Alternate path upgrade 1 purchased (used to retain details of upgrades on the other path when switching path as a repose or in SuperChargers)
* Bit 12: Alternate path upgrade 2 purchased
* Bit 13: Alternate path upgrade 3 purchased

### Usage info

Unknown. TODO in future

### Heroic Challenges

* Heroic Challenges are sprawled out over 2 different areas. One `uint32_t` at block 0x0D/0x29, offset 0x06, and another `uint24_t` at block 0x12/0x2E, offset 0x04.
* The first one of these accords to the Heroic Challenges in Spyro's Adventure, and the second one the Heroic Challenges introduced in Giants.
* Each bit corresponds to a boolean indicating whether or not the heroic challenge has been complete by the Skylander.
* Their offset into the bit field is the same as their internally stored identifier. For Giants Heroics, add 32 to their offset to reveal the true heroic ID. This essentially means that if you append the Giants heroic bytes to the start of the SSA heroic bytes, then using their ID would give you the corresponding bit.
* Assume `SSA` refers to the 4 bytes for SSA heroics, and `SG` for the other 3 bytes.
