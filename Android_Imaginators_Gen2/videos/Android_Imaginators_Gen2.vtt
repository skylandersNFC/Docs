00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.383
This is how we write imaginators with your Android phone

00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:04.159
Using a Gen 2 tags

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.480
or in this case

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.560
Gen 2 key fobs.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.649
You can also use cards, round tags and so on.

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:12.240
But they need to be

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.640
a Gen 2.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.936
On my Android phone I have the Mifare Classic Tool application

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.840
and I already have some dumps imported here.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.160
They are file format MCT.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.480
So how did I get those?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.120
I've transferred some original NFC dumps to my phone.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.420
They are inside my "Downloads" folder and now using the "Tools".

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.372
And "Import/Export/Convert files" menu.

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:37.359
I went to "Import dumps", I went to ".bin/.mfd/.dump".

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.521
And now I see inside my "Downloads" folder,

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:45.759
those are the original dump files.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.875
That's the original format.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.959
And when I imported them with the program, they were converted to MCT format.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.050
Those are the files that I'm using now.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.000
And the original dumps,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.080
they're from the Ultimate NFC Pack.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.560
Pretty much they're the most proper ones.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.240
I only have a creation crystals for Skylanders Imaginators.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.967
What I'm going to do, I'm going to use this

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:10.359
"Write Tag" option.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.103
I'm going to "Write Dump (Clone)"

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:17.616
and I'm going to "Show Options", Because I need to click here on this

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:20.919
"Advanced: Enable writing to manufacturer block"

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.520
I need to have this option selected.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.348
I need to get one of the tags,

00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:29.120
and it needs to be registered with the NFC writer.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.160
See on the bottom it says "New UID found".

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.040
Now this tag is registered.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.320
I use this menu to select them.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.419
Right now we are doing the first dump - Fire Acorn

00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:45.180
Select the dump and now the process here

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:46.360
it's done in 3 steps.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.286
The first step is flashing all the other sectors,

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.439
but not sector 0.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.880
You just deselect sector 0.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.366
We don't want to flash sector 0 on the first run,

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:00.135
so we flash it from 1 to 15

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:01.520
Which is the last sector.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120
I click OK, it asks for keys.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.024
Those are empty tags,

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:08.439
so the keys will be standard keys.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.480
I click start mapping and it says "3 keys loaded".

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160
All the sectors here are now recognized.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680
It says "Warning: The Access conditions will be irreversible"

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.800
That's OK.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
You click "Write as much as possible"

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
Click that and now you are done with this step.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.804
Now some people recommended that you just re-register the tag

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:34.244
see that the tag was re-registered

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:37.541
And now I go to the second part

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:38.759
and the second part is a bit tricky.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
Right now we have from sector 1 to sector 15.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.440
We need sector 0 as well.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.486
We go back again, we go to the same menu

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:49.279
"Write Dump"

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.880
We go to the "Show options"

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.160
we go to the "Advanced: Enable writing to manufacturer block".

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.600
Now we click "Select dump" and use the same dump.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.640
You need to be very careful here.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.160
You cannot use another dump.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.400
Go there.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.182
Now from all this, you just click "select none"

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.553
and you select "Sector 0",

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.160
the only sector that we were missing.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.240
And now this is the important part.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.280
Now I'm going to use again the standard keys.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.080
And now look at this.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.126
It says on sector 0 there are several blocks,

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:28.179
and on sector 0, block 0 and block 3

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:29.400
will be filled with data.

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.624
And it says on sector 0, block 0

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:35.159
The UID will be changed.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.025
The UID, BCC, SAK, ATAQ and everything else

00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:42.600
will be filled with data in this order.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.837
And now that's a bit of an issue because now

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.720
the card is registered with its original UID.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.319
If we go down here and remember, the original UID

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:53.359
was shown here.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.949
And now when I click write as much as possible,

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:59.964
the first thing it will going to do, it will

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.840
overwrite the original UID.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.366
The moment it overwrites the UID, the tag will disconnect

00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:07.889
and I won't be able to write the other things

00:04:07.944 --> 00:04:09.480
like the rest of the blocks.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.840
Look at this.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.254
Now I click "write as much as possible"

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.879
And let's look at the bottom here

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.279
I click on it and now the UID was instantly

00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:22.946
rewritten and the tag disconnected

00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:24.439
and that was not a whole Sector 0 write.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.920
What I need to do?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.720
I need to just re-register this tag again.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.277
Now I go back there and I go "Select Dump"

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:36.119
With "Advanced Manufacturer enabled"

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.970
I go here again on the same thing and now

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:41.920
I also use "Select None".

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.925
I then select "Sector 0" and now with the new UID

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.297
because now I have the new UID

00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:50.599
from the NFC dump itself.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.235
I continue this step and now it will actually write

00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:57.680
the BCC, SAK, ATAQ and so on.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.800
And now they are finally written.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.660
See data successfully written and now if I try to

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:06.803
read the tag again or write to this tag,

00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:10.676
I won't be able to because now the keys are

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:11.480
completely different.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.840
I will select all of them for the test.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.468
I'm trying to recognize this tag and it says

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:21.152
"No valid key found", because this tag already

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.760
have a proper creation crystal on it.
