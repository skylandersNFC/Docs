All thx to "ItsSecretNate" and "mafflmao", who told me about the process.

You can generate the "Heartbreaker Buckshot" dump with the RPCS3 or CEMU emulators.

**Heartbreaker Buckshot IDs**
`ID 618   VARIANT_ID 21516`

I'm not sharing it as file, since people will start thinking they can flash it on NFC cards.
This is not possible, it only works inside an emulator with the Portal Thread suspended workaround showed above.
