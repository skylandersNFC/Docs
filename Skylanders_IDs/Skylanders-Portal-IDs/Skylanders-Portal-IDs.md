# Skylanders Portal IDs
Internal digital Skylanders Portal of Power IDs (along with their FCC IDs for physical model identification purposes), used to identify the Portal using software, such as to reject non-Traptanium Portals in Skylanders Trap Team.

The ID is sent out as part of a response from the Portal of Power after sending it a report beginning with 0x52 ('R'). It is possible with the Wii Wireless Portal of Power and respective Wii Wireless Dongle (from what I personally own and from my own personal test/observations) to receive a response with the ID 0x90 0x00, although I am led to believe this is a bug as I have no definitive answer as to why this can occur.

These are all Portals I can personally verify, including the SWAP Force Retail Demo Portal of Power, and many (if not all) of the FCC IDs can be verified independently [here](https://fccid.io/XLU). If you can personally verify that you own a specific Portal of Power and can also obtain its digital ID and/or optionally its FCC ID (if it is somehow exempt from this list), please feel free to submit an issue with the information. There are some Portals here with a '?' as I cannot personally verify the exact information about the Portal at this moment in time.

Note that the Wireless Dongles do have their own FCC IDs and model no. but have been excluded from the list.
